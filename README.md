# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
Dana developped a website where the UFO sighting information can be read. She added the new design that allows users to fitere UFO sighting information by place, date, and UFO's shape. This report is for analyzing the benefit and drawback of this new filter function so she can improve the website design and function.

## Results
The new function allows users to filter information by place, date, and UFO's shape. This means that the users can do more specific research about reported UFO sightings. For example, users are specifically curious about UFOs in San Diego, they can filter by city as shown in the image below:

## Summary

Recommendation
It is recommended to make it possible to filter based on the period rather than just dates. Duration format in the table is not consistant. Some say "seconds" "minutes" and others say "sec" "mins". We should clean the data format by using ETL method.
